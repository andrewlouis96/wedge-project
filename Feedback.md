## Feedback 

Nice work on this project, you can consider it complete. I'm going to read your files in order and give you feedback
as I move through them, from Task 1 to Task 3. 

I appreciated your reflection and I'm glad that you learned something so profound from the class! (Even if that was merely a byproduct of my teaching.) To be honest, I don't usually worry too much about the motivation for the work we do in class. I feel like we're learning broadly applicable skills: getting clean data is something that everybody needs. You make a good point, however, and I think I could spend a little bit more time, connecting the dots to the way in which these classes are actually exploring universal techniques. Thanks for the reflections.


### Task 1

* Nice work, this is super efficient.

### Task 2

* Nice job on this task. 
* It'd be worth thinking through how you'd do this the reproducible way. That'd involve selecting distinct card numbers, pulling them down to python, calling `random.sample` and then building a query that could use them all. Let me know if it's not clear how you'd do that.
* I don't think you could do this in fewer lines of code....

### Task 3

* Nice job on this, also very efficient.
