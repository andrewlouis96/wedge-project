You're missing the "submission.md" file. Fill that out and include it in your repo. Send me a teams message when you've done that so I'll know to look 
at it. 

### Task 1

* You're getting some errors here. You may need to define the pandas column types to avoid it. 

### Task 2

* Nice job on this task. 
* I appreciate that you took the time to do this with the reproducible approach. 
* It'd be worth thinking through how you'd do this the reproducible way. That'd involve selecting distinct card numbers, pulling them down to python, calling `random.sample` and then building a query that could use them all. Let me know if it's not clear how you'd do that. 


### Task 3

* The best practice is to create a requirements.txt file for a project, rather than having your pip install calls in your cells. ChatGPT is pretty good at explaining the concept.
* Nice job on this, quite efficient.
